# 📊 Task 3 – Bank Marketing Decision Tree

This task uses the **UCI Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using a **Decision Tree Classifier**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classification model using **demographic** and **behavioral features** of customers to determine the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📁 Files

- `bank_marketing_task03.ipynb`: Main notebook with preprocessing, model building & evaluation
- `bank.csv`: Dataset used

## 📌 Key Steps

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training using Decision Tree
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
6. Insights and conclusions

---

## ✅ Outcome

A trained Decision Tree model that classifies whether a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit, based on given input features.
