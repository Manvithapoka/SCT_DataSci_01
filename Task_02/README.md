# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

This task involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights that could influence survival outcomes.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and extract meaningful insights related to:
- Survival distribution
- Gender and age demographics
- Class-wise survival rates
- Embarkation port influence

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Females had a significantly higher survival rate** compared to males.
- **Passengers in 1st class** had better survival chances than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- **Younger passengers**, especially children, had higher survival rates.
- Passengers who **embarked from Cherbourg (C)** had a better survival probability.
